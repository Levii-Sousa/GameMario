# GameMario
In this project I basically made the google dino game, but being Mario. It was made with HTML, CSS anD JAVASCRIPT. 
Initially I started the project with html, linking the HTML with CSS and JAVASCRIPT,
Then I created the game-board class to be used in the CSS,
and finally I added the necessary images.
And the hardest parts were the animations with the CSS,
and applications in JAVASCRIPT.
